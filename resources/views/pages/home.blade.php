            <p>Wednesday, February 10th was a day that forever changed Fargo. As many of you know, a domestic
                disturbance
                call escalated into a horrific series of events that left two dead in the wake of tragedy. Like you,
                the people of our neighborhood mourn the tragic losses of that night. We wanted to show our support for
                those affected by this tragedy and, as a neighborhood, felt this simple act could be a powerful
                expression
                of love and support. </p>
            <p>We stand together to mourn the losses faced by the Moszer family. We also stand beside
                Michelle Schumacher who lost her husband and has to move on wading through a very difficult time of loss
                and pain.
                If you choose to shine a light, or see one at someoneâ€™s door, remember the Moszer family, remember the
                Schumacher family.</p>
